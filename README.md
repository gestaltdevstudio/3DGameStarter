3D Game Starter is the 3D version of 2D Game Starter - A Initial Game Code created in C++ from scratch, with some basic LIBs - often presents in game engines: GLFW, GLAD, GLM, OpenAL, LibZIP, OGG and Vorbis.

# CAUTION!! WIP, not recommended YET!
  
## Motivation and Manifest 
This project was created to consolidate some ideas and concepts used in Gestalt Dev Studio games. You can start your game cloning this .git or just taking some classes, pieces of code, or concepts from here to make your own game engine, which I recommend, because this project represents one way of thinking, not the right way, or the way you'll be more confortable to work with!

Why so simple or why "to reinvent the wheel"? The main objective here is to generate conscience of what you are doing, or extending from other devs. Every little step you do results in a layer that you can enjoy and go up to the next level and so on.
